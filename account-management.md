# Account and Project Management

The purpose of this section is to clearly distinguish between the responsibilities of Sales, Account Management and Project Management as part of the larger focuses of XWP on Delivery and Engagement. 

XWP needs to ensure that existing clients remain happy with our services and provide us with healthy ongoing work. At the same time we require additional clients to support our growth and stability.

At the end is a summarized view of the role descriptions for Account Manager \(AM\) and Project Manager \(PM\), mainly just to explain the delineation.

## Broad Objectives

Individuals may participate in more than one of the functions described within Service Delivery or Engagement while we are running lean, but to avoid confusion in what we mean when we discuss these functions, it is important to define what they are in a way that will be relevant as we expand and grow.

### Service Delivery

Service Delivery as a whole is accountable for delivering products and services to clients. Success is measured by the following key activities:

* Objective estimation and pricing
* Staffing capacity prediction and management
* Quality control, including setting and maintaining deadlines and timelines
* Efficient allocation of staff time

The functions within Service Delivery include:

* Staffing/resourcing management: keeping projects staffed with the right people, managing hourly costs, and keeping those people happy
* Product Owner: defining and prioritizing product needs for each client
* Project Management: estimating cost, time and capacity for new projects and managing active projects, [as described in further detail below](account-management.md#project-manager). 
* Delivery Operations: The operational support to allow the other functions to proceed efficiently, such as information systems, delivery process planning, and pre-sales resource coordination, as examples.

### Engagement

Sometimes referred to as Sales or Growth, Engagement as a whole is accountable for the objective of achieving revenue growth. Success is measured by the following key activities:

* Attracting new leads \(Sales\)
* Attracting new opportunities for current clients \(AM\)
* Closing new opportunities \(Sales\)
* Closing new opportunities for current clients \(Sales\)
* Maximizing recurring revenue \(Sales/AM/PM\)

The functions within Engagement include: 

* Marketing \(Sales\): create awareness by building brand equity, and attracting new inbound leads
* Business Development \(Sales\): Create awareness through networking, outreach and strategic partnerships, to generate demand and drive referrals
* Sales: qualify \(inbound and outbound\) leads and convert to late-stage opportunities
* Account Management: maximizing opportunities, and maximizing recurring revenue by working with Service Delivery, [as described in further detail below](account-management.md#account-manager). 
* Revenue Operations \(Sales\): providing operational support to allow the other functions to proceed efficiently, such as information systems and management, sales enablement content, and managing non-billable sales expenses as examples.

## Handover process

Once a new client has signed their contract \(for a managed project\), the Operations Team will assign a Project Manager. Sales will arrange two internal handover meetings:

1.  AM/PM \(+ any team members already assigned to the project\) and anyone that was involved with the Sales process
   1. Sales to review the proposal and Client Project Brief in this call
      1. Project Brief, documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148bjn-9sRihk3MFERyrjFmmEVIzSRmC217G5xBMb81c/edit) - Sales to fill out prior to this internal call
   2. Ideally recorded, using Zoom, to share with anyone not able to attend \(e.g. not yet assigned to the project\)
2. Internal kickoff meeting with the PM and entire assigned Delivery Team to set the team up for the External Client kickoff
   1. PM to review the proposal and Client Project Brief in this call
      1. Project Brief, documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148bjn-9sRihk3MFERyrjFmmEVIzSRmC217G5xBMb81c/edit) - Sales to fill out prior to this internal call
   2. Ideally recorded, using Zoom, to share with anyone not able to attend \(e.g. not yet assigned to the project\)

### Guidelines of Success

1. Why did the client buy the product?
2. What problem are they trying to solve, and/or what goals are they trying to accomplish?
3. What does success mean for the client?
4. Who is the Buyer of the product?
5. Who are the Influencers, Champions, and Detractors within the account?
6. What are potential roadblocks one may face in making the project/client successful?

Once the internal calls are completed, the next step is to arrange a kickoff meeting with the PM, AM, delivery team and client. Once the kickoff is complete, the PM is the primary day-to-day point of contact for the client, whereas the AM is involved in scheduled meetings to maintain the overall relationship \(outside of just the existing contract\), and allow for a channel of escalation \(if need be\).

## The Collaboration

**In order for this model to work the AM and PM need to be a team. Each responsible for their own Areas of Focus but unified in the goal to maintain client satisfaction, and grow existing business.** 

Specific to ownership of “growth”: whereby Account Management is responsible for new business leads, with existing clients, and Project Management for managing the existing contract/project, and the ongoing growth of that work.

Specific to ownership of communication: Day-to-day communication will lie with the PM for all managed projects. The Account Manager’s involvement will pertain to a scheduled fortnightly/monthly/quarterly meeting with the Client \(preceded by an internal meeting with the PM\), alongside the Project Manager, and when issues are escalated to the Account Manager.

Specific to ownership of new business with existing clients: All growth within the existing project will fall on the PM to lead out, as needed. When growth outside of the current project arises \(e.g. ToD, a separate project with the Client, etc.\), the PM or a member of their team may be the first to hear about it. The PM will share with the AM any information the client has communicated to them in their day-to-day communication during the next internal meeting unless urgency requires more timely discussion. If the AM becomes aware of opportunities that arise outside of the PM’s awareness, the AM will similarly discuss with the PM, prior to fleshing out the opportunity further. All new business leads with the client will begin with conversations during the external meetings, however, Account Management will lead continued discussions about the new work with the client and XWP Sales.

### Meetings

#### Internal Account Sync \(Fortnightly/Monthly/Quarterly\)

Who: AM and PM 

What: The AM and PM sync to discuss any project details that transpired since the last sync. Is the project going well? Have there been any glitches? Has the client asked for additional team members? Has the client increased/decreased hours or scope? Etc.

When: Preceding the external meeting

#### Executive Sponsor Sync \(Fortnightly/Monthly/Quarterly\)

Who: AM, PM and Client

What: Review project details/status, and talk about any change \(good or bad\), ask the client if they have any needs, etc.

When: After the internal fortnightly meeting

Note: Ideally the PM and AM develop a format/agenda for this call that is structurally followed every time. Each client will warrant a slightly different format, and variation from client to client is ok so long as the AM and PM are aligned.

### General Communication

We use Slack to communicate asynchronously. Sales and Account Management specific communication should be discussed with the PM prior to adding it into any internal project Slack channels, to avoid distraction from project work/confusion in the internal Slack channel.

### Should and Should Nots

#### Should

* Share when any meetings are scheduled outside of the normal projects/account meetings
  * Share notes/high level takeaways of ad-hoc meetings
* Communicate any details pertaining to changes to the project
* Communicate any indications of possible additional work
* Share any contracts with PM before sharing with the client for review, allowing \(at minimum\) 1 business day to review prior to sending, this includes reviewing MSAs/SOWs
* Identify ownership and deadlines for all account tasks

#### Should Nots

* Assume either individual knows what is happening outside of routine discussions
* Duplicate conversation efforts with the client

## Account Manager

### Summary

The Account Manager \(AM\) is responsible for the development of new business leads with existing clients. The core focus is to field new opportunities with Accounts they manage for XWP and convert them to additional revenue within the client account. Once a lead becomes a new project, there is a handover process to the assigned Project Manager for the day-to-day communication.

### Areas of Focus

* Reassuring client’s intent to purchase
* Supporting Sales, as needed, on the terms of the agreement \(description of services from Service Delivery and approval of commercial terms from Finance\)
* Taking point for additional opportunities with existing clients outside of the existing contract/project \(in conjunction with the PM Area of Focus: Identify additional opportunities for XWP\)
* Managing client experience when PM escalates client service issues for active engagements

### Guidelines for Success

* Are we signing up new leads to keep our current staff working and to grow the business?
* Are our internal projects growing outside of their current projects?
* Do clients understand the scope of offerings that may be of interest to them?
* Is the client able to avoid frustration in establishing and with the commercial terms of their engagement?

## Project Manager

### Summary

The Project Manager \(PM\) once assigned to a project, is responsible for the relationship with the client. The core two items of focus are: 

1. The current project that the client has engaged XWP for
   1. Any additional needs to provide the client value and satisfaction within the existing contract \(includes, but not limited to scaling up/down the team\)
   2. Growing, maintaining and continuing \(e.g. future phases\) of the existing project  
2. Main day-to-day point of contact for the client  

The PM needs to ensure the projects that they manage are set up for success, remain on track specific to deliverables, timeline, resourcing, and budget, and serve as the primary point-of-contact for the client of the projects they manage.

### Areas for Focus

* Client communication
* Project financial monitoring and reporting
* SOW deliverable tracking
* Project timeline
* Gathering info for additional opportunities for XWP \(in conjunction with the AM Area of Focus: Taking point, and adhering to the above 3 points, for additional opportunities with existing clients outside of the existing contract/project\)

### Guidelines of Success

* Is the project on track for budget/scope?
* Did we meet the resourcing demands of the project?
* Are team members efficiently allocating their time on the project?
* Is the client happy with our current delivery?
* Is the client interested in working further with XWP?
* Would the client recommend our services to a colleague?
