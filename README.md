# Introduction

## Purpose

Serve the needs of our Clients by providing excellent service, high quality work, and measurable value through creating long-term relationships.

## What is XWP Delivery?

Delivery at XWP focuses on Client-facing work that engages a managed team. A managed team being defined as a team working with an internal Project Manager and/or Product Owner. Delivery projects have deliverables, logically.

We also engage with Clients using a Talent on Demand \(ToD\) model. When XWP is engaged in this way the role of a PM/PO is very limited and exists mainly for billing and tracking the success and health of staff placed on the ToD project — this is typically more of a Project Coordinator/Account Manager role than traditional project management.

## How should Delivery function?

Each internal team is focused on serving a Client project. The Project Manager tasked with the Client project is responsible for the project’s growth \(both in size and continuation\), ensuring the health of the team, and tracking/reporting the financial health of the project. The Product Owner is responsible for the project backlog and defining the goals of the project and ensuring that XWP delivers what the client wants/needs. The Architect or Engineering Lead is responsible for the technical solution, helps define requirements with the PO, and reviews the work of, and mentors, the Engineers on the project.

The same team may serve multiple Clients, or a team member may serve on multiple teams across different projects with the same or different Clients.

As new opportunities arise with existing Clients the Delivery Team works with the Account Manager/Sales Rep to explore the opportunity and grow the account. See [Account Management](account-management.md) for specific details on how Delivery and Sales collaborate with existing Clients.

### **Delivery Process Tracking with** [**Monday.com**](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide)\*\*\*\*

All board documentation can be found in the [Operations Handbook](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/).

From a high level the main boards related to delivery are listed below. Note: the [Revenue Pipeline](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide/sales/revenue-pipeline) board is owned by Sales, but serves a dual purpose with Delivery.

* The [Revenue Pipeline](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide/sales/revenue-pipeline) board is used to track all opportunities until they are disqualified or complete.
* The [Client Directory](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide/delivery/client-directory) board is used to track the main contact and signatory of an organization.
* The [Delivery Tasks](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide/delivery/delivery-tasks) board is used to track all operational tasks related to upcoming and active projects. These are tasks that do **not** belong in a project specific Jira board and are **not** client facing.
* The [Project Budget](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide/delivery/project-budget) board is used to track the total and remaining budget of a project.
* The [Project Revenue](https://docs.xwp.co/operations-handbook/monday-guide/delivery/project-revenue) board is used to track all invoicing related to a project.

## How is Delivery success measured?

A healthy Delivery project makes for a happy Client that strongly feels they are receiving/have received value as they work with XWP.

**Note:** Quantifiable measurements of success will exist on a project-by-project basis and should be defined during the start of the project by the Delivery Team in conjunction with the Account Manager/Sales Rep.
