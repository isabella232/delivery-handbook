# Estimating

Whenever a new project is in the works, and a client is looking for a detailed understanding of the effort level to achieve the desired outcomes, it is in our best interest to accurately estimate the project. The Sales Team will ensure the Delivery Team is aware of the need, including any known information about the project expectations, timeline, and budget so they can fulfill the estimation requirements.

Follow these steps:

1. The Project Manager will gather all relevant data from Sales / Account Manager / Client
   1. RFP/Project Brief
   2. Epic list
   3. Any supporting documentation that exists
   4. Code base - if possible
2. Make a copy of the [\[TEMPLATE Client Name\] Estimation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KE_EXXlL_LVyyy36aVydDrt7GR_yYV1OVKyhfE9E5js) to guide the estimation process, save it within the project folder in Google Drive — the Sales Team should have already created this folder. If they have not, please save the pre-created set of sub-folders in the [Project Folder Structure](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n8jo4gv1KyW6xlFwsU2ku7XymKoptYxf) folder, to your computer. Then, highlight all of those folders and drag them back into the newly set up Project folder for your client, under [Active Projects](https://drive.google.com/open?id=107B9EaPa_Xk6nTttPahVuscKB97f-tiE), in the Delivery &gt; Client Projects sub-folder. Note: if you experience issues with moving these folders onto your computer and back into the gDrive, please let Mackenzie or Derek know and we will assist in moving them \(as how you move them is dependent on your computer/device type\).
   1. Ask the Sales and Operations Team for support in estimating and providing the required people
   2. As a team fill out the “Epic Estimate” tab with all known epics and user stories
   3. Estimates should be started in a 1-2 hour meeting with everyone then asynchronous, followed by a meeting to review and validate
   4. Once the epic estimate has all hours represented by roles, review the rhythms and ceremonies tab to validate budget
      1. Updating the “start” and “end” dates will automatically update the number of Sprints
      2. Row 24 will pull data in from the “Epic Estimate” tab
         1. Note: PO, PM and QA are calculated based on percentages
      3. Once you have entered an assumed the timeline for the work, look at row 27 to see if there are team members that will be over capacity, and increase the number in row 30 until the hours/week are manageable.
      4. All meeting time will update based on the duration of the project, and the number of team members.
      5. Once epics are estimated, estimated timeline is entered, and number of team members are adjusted you will be able to see the assumed total hours in cell J25 along with the estimated cost.
