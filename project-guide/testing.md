### Quality Assurance \(QA\)

@todo describe this section

### Recommended Configurations

1. **Mobile**: Android \(newest\) / iPhone  iOS _Choose a couple of devices for Android and iPhone to cover off on smaller and larger mobile viewports,  and on newer and an older version of Android and iOs._
2. **Tablet breakpoints** \(ie. iPad or iPad mini and/or Surface tablets\)
3. **Desktop**: Newest Chrome, Safari \(Mac\) desktop, Firefox \(newest -assuming their stats warrant\) and Windows 10, Edge newest. _For Desktop, make sure to confirm responsiveness at extra large and small screen break points._

### Notes

* Responsiveness that is more likely to be an issue than browsers, or OS. 
* Ensuring the site works well using keyboard/mouse, and touch
* If the project requires accessibility \(note: all should\) check accessibility keyboard navigation
* Windows Explorer, is more likely to cause issues than the other browsers.
* Regarding versioning: Chrome, and Firefox automatically update, generally without the user being aware, and both iOS and Windows, also prompt frequent updates, so generally it’s best to test with the newest version available for the OS you’re testing at the time of testing
  * In some cases it might make sense to create visual regression tests with a service like BrowserStack
