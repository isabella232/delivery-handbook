# Onboarding & Transitions

See the [Onboarding checklist](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MPVJ9W8TCc_0_OxeVAoePqVFSf13Qa_sWCQ1vvSFIro) template for a detailed list of tasks new team members or team members moving from one project to the next, could be added to, when they start with XWP or on a new project. Some services, or tasks, are not needed for all roles and we should follow the **principle of least privilege** when adding new users. For example, if a user does not need access to the Pantheon or WP Engine servers in their day-to-day operations then we do not give them access. The same is true for Monday.com.

## New to XWP

* Please reach out People Services \(Arlen\) for an Onboarding Checklist. If you have not already received one - here is the [Onboarding checklist](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MPVJ9W8TCc_0_OxeVAoePqVFSf13Qa_sWCQ1vvSFIro) template.
* Please schedule a meeting \(if not already scheduled\) with Arlen, People Services and Mackenzie Hartung for Delivery Onboarding.
* Please schedule a meeting \(if not already scheduled\) with Derek, CTO.

## New to a Project

* If you are the Project Manager, please reach out to Mackenzie and Arlen to schedule a meeting and see the New PM to a Project section below.
* PMs\(s\) onboarding a new team member
  1. Use tab 1 of the [Onboarding Checklist](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MPVJ9W8TCc_0_OxeVAoePqVFSf13Qa_sWCQ1vvSFIro) to onboard a new team member \(or returning XWP employee/contractor or coming from X-Team\) to your project, once they are added to your project by Arlen, Derek, Mackenzie or Tanya. 
  2. Use tab 2 for a project to project move.
  3. Share the Onboarding Checklist with the team member to ensure all items are completed.
  4. Schedule a meeting with the new team member for the current project you are onboarding \(if you are the Project Manager, schedule a meeting with Arlen and Mackenzie\). Discuss everything in the Onboarding Checklist.
     * After the initial meeting concludes, ask the Project Manager \(or XWP Admin\) for the following \(_all listed in the Checklist_\):
       1. To be added to the Harvest project, and hours to be added in Forecast
       2. To be added to all ticket management locations and repos \(internal and external\)
       3. To be added to all Slack channels
       4. To be introduced to the Client
       5. To be added to all relevant internal and Client meetings
* If the new hire is an Engineer,  they should schedule a meeting with the Lead Engineer/Architect. During this meeting cover:
  1. Get a technical overview of the solution for the work
  2. Understand upcoming sprints, and their objectives
  3. Understand workflows and deployments
  4. Technical information handoff of the project and any context to help them get started
* New Team Members should review:
  1. The Google Drive location for your project, for any relevant information
  2. Client Project Brief
  3. SOW / Contract / MSA
  4. The Project Documentation
  5. Any documentation shared by the PM \(audits, discoveries, etc., all that apply\)

## Transitioning Projects

These steps are the difference between a rocky transition and a smooth one.

### New PM to a Project 

When a new PM joins XWP or a client is moving from one Team to another, it is important that the most informed people attempt to inform those taking over.

* Collecting important links in Google Drive \(especially an updated Project Brief\), forwarding any key emails, and noting Jira tickets worth reviewing
* Discussing key personality traits can help the team know how best to meet the client's needs and work efficiently in the future
* Creating a detailed checklist of all XWP and external responsibilities that the current PM has for each project \(to make sure the new PM has been onboarded to own all of them appropriately\)
* Ensure the new PM is included on all external/internal meetings and that the "Guests can: Modify event" option is selected so the new PM can alter the invite as necessary
* Ensure the new PM is set as owner for project files on Google Drive
* Ensure the new PM has appropriate privileges for Jira, GitHub, and any client-specific Google calendars
* Add the new PM to relevant internal/external Slack channels
* Update Forecast to replace former PM hours on projects with the new PM
* Update Harvest to add the new PM as a Project Manager on all projects
* Transition all budget and reporting requirements to the new PM
* Update Monday.com to include new PM for future months in place of the former PM, likely best to append new PM to former PM for any months where they overlap \(e.g., "Tanya Herman / Tom Stinson"\)

### Tasks

* Schedule internal meeting with the Operations Team and existing Project Manager
  * Determine risks and complexities
* Communicate to the existing team of the transition on the Slack channel
* Existing Project Manager or Sales Team to fill out an updated [Client Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148bjn-9sRihk3MFERyrjFmmEVIzSRmC217G5xBMb81c/edit?usp=sharing) with any relevant information based on the current phase of the project
* Schedule internal meeting with Delivery Lead, existing Account Manager, existing Project Manager, new Project Manager, existing Architect and new Architect \(if applicable\)
  * Review the state of the current project
  * Review the transition Client Project Brief, share with all on call
  * Determine timeline for transition
  * Determine POC for communicating change \(default to Account Manager\)
* Create a Transition Plan
* Account Manager \(or POC assigned if not Account Manager\) to schedule a meeting with the Client to inform of, and review, team change

### Client Introduction

* Have the Account Manager, alongside the existing Project Manager, introduce the new Project Manager via email and on Slack, if one has already been created.
* Speak freely about existing meetings, and any changes that need to be made to scheduling \(ideally, minimal\).
* Allow a transitional period, if possible, where both Project Managers are available with the new Project Manager taking point.

### Post-Transfer Follow-up

The Account Manager must follow-up with the Client on the success of the transition and should happen within 2-4 weeks â€” when the follow-up meeting is scheduled, depends on the length and complexity of the project and cadence of the existing meetings.

### Tips for Maximizing Success

When introducing a new Project Manager, make sure to market/promote the person in a way that the client will respect. This could include mentioning big clients the PM has worked with before, or some interesting personal fact\(s\) that the client might relate to. Find a way to connect the Client with the new PM in a meaningful way.
