# PO 101

## Defining the vision

Product Owners must be the voice of the user. Working with the clients/stakeholders, you must understand and be able to outline the concept of the product and the features it will have. 

1. What is the purpose of the product?
2. Who are the users?
3. Why are we building the product? 

## Creating / Maintaining Backlog

With the vision defined, the main role of the Product Owner is to create and maintain the backlog! The backlog is a list of features that need to be developed. This can come in the form of tickets in Jira or issues in Github. Items in the backlog can have different types including epics, user stories and bugs. With a backlog built, the team knows what work needs to be done. 

## Creating Tickets

Tickets are broken down features that will be handed off to an engineer to develop. Engineers should be able to read a ticket and understand a basic scenario of the feature, the motivation for building it and the criteria required to fulfill the needs of the ticket. In order to satisfy these requirements, tickets typically have a user story and acceptance criteria. Tickets can also have design mocks and even QA notes.
