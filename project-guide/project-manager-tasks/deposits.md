# Deposits

We generally collect a deposit at the onset of an engagement. Currently, our standard deposit amount is $10,000 USD. This does vary sometimes. 

A deposit is simply a security we add when working with Clients. If a Client has a $30,000 budget, and we have collected a $10,000 deposit. This Client still has a $30,000 budget...the $10,000 deposit gets applied at the end of the project. Therefore, when managing projects with deposits...still review budget, and burn, according to their total budget. The $10,000 up front should not be subtracted from the total budget. Instead we just credit the last invoice\(s\) with the money put into the deposit up front.

Therefore, it is important that if your project has a Deposit you are drawing down that deposit as the project nears its end.

_What does this mean?_

We do not want to be in a situation where we need to credit the deposit back to a Client. Therefore, we do our best to apply the deposit to the last payment\(s\) the Client needs to make. As the project gets underway it is best to take note of your average invoice. If the average invoice is higher than the deposit it is a solid rule of thumb that whenever we send out the last invoice, we will apply the total deposit value, and square away. Two examples of this:

* **Example 1:** Client A has a $10,000 deposit. During the project their average invoice is $25,000. The last invoice goes out at the completion of the project for $24,500. We apply the $10,000 deposit and Client A owes us a final payment of $14,500.
* **Example 2:** Client B has a $10,000 deposit. During the project their average invoice is $10,000. The last invoice goes out at the completion of the project for $10,000. We apply the $10,000 deposit and Client B does not owe us any money for the last invoice.

If you notice the Client invoices are generally lower than the deposit value, you will need to draw down the deposit over the course of multiple final payments. Two examples of this:

* **Example 3**: Client C has a $10,000 deposit. During the project their average invoice is $5,000. We are winding down on work, and have ~2 invoices remaining. The second to last invoice goes out at $5,000, and we apply $5,000 of the $10,000 deposit. The Client does not pay anything on this invoice. The final invoice goes out 2 weeks later, for another $5,000, and we apply the remaining $5,000 of the $10,000 deposit. The Client does not pay anything on this invoice either. 
* **Example 4**: Client D has a $10,000 deposit. During the project their average invoice is $5,000.We are winding down on work, and have ~2 invoices remaining. The second to last invoice goes out for $6,000 \(a bit higher than the average\), and we apply $5,000 of the $10,000 deposit. The Client pays $1,000 of this invoice. The final invoice goes out 2 weeks later, for $7,000 \(also a bit higher than the average\), and we apply the remaining $5,000 of the $10,000 deposit. The Client pays the outstanding $2,000 remaining and we are all squared away.

## How to Log this in Monday

Deposit application should be added to an invoice as a credit \(negative\) line item in [Monday.com](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/375085277).

When actually logging a draw down of a deposit, please ensure you flag Finance \(Monika\) to align with her that there will be a deposit deduction. After entering in all normal lines in Monday.com for the invoicing period for the Client, add in an additional line and title it "Deposit Draw" or "Deposit Draw \#1" \(in the event the deposit will be drawn over multiple invoices\). In the "Deposit" column enter in the negative dollar amount being drawn down against the deposit \(e.g. "-$10,000\). This line will be subtracted from the total invoice amount when Monika generates and sends to the Client.
