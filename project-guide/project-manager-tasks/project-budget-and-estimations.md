# Project Budget and Forecasting

We utilize Monday.com to track out project budgets, and our estimations \(projections\). Specifically, there are two boards within Monday.com that need to be updated frequently...the [Project Budget & Health board](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/384969577) and the [Revenue board](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/1082445381).

## Project Budget & Health Board \(Budget\)

This board lists all of our current projects, and displays at a high level what the overal budget is for the project compared to what we have already burned through. This board is updated weekly by Project Manager's after they have reviewed hours for the prior week.

### Setup

When you have a new project kick off you will need to add a line to this board for the new project. To do so follow the below steps:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the "Budget Available" section
2. You will see "+add" in the last row, select within the "+add" area and type in the name of the Client / Project
3. Once the new item is added you can begin populating the supplemental columns
4. If you are the Project Manager, assign yourself in the **PM** column, otherwise select the team member serving as the PM for this project
5. If there are multiple phases of the work this can be identified in the **Phase** column \(example: 1, 2, Discovery, Audit, etc.\)
6. If a PO\# exists for the SOW please add it in the **PO\#** column
7. The **Current Budget** column should contain the total budget available \(in USD\) based on the SOW, or the current understanding of total budget from the Client
   1. Note: for ongoing projects a good rule of thumb is to update the Current Budget any time you update Forecast. If we have confirmation/approval for work the Current Budget should be incrementally increased to reflect that. 
8. **Actual Spend** depicts the amount of the budget we have burned. If the project you are adding the actual budget for is T&M this is simply the number of billable hours worked by the team, multiplied by the hourly rate defined in the SOW. If the project is fixed, or being billed on installments, this number should reflect the total of fixed invoices sent.
9. You will also need to select the proper **Project Code** \(last column\).

### Updating 

This board should be **updated weekly.**  After you have reviewed hours for the week, or if another installment of a fixed amount was sent to the Client, the "Actual Spend" column should be updated.

Once updated the Remaining Budget and Budget Used columns will automatically calculate.

## Project Revenue Board \(Forecasting and Invoicing\)

Aside from tracking our current budget spend \(above\), we also forecast out estimations to help us remaing on track with overall spend. This happens in the [Current Fiscal Year Revenue Board](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/1082445381).

For setup of this board, and understanding how to populate it for invoicing purposes, please review the [Invoicing](invoicing.md) page.

Once Forecast is updated for the coming month, and you have an idea of the number of hours each team member will be working, please enter those hours \(for the payment period\) in the "Est. Hours" column. 

Each line item in the Project Revenue board is based on an invoicing period. For instance...a team with Tanya, Mike, and Anne Louise is invoiced monthly, each of those individuals would represent a line within the project for the month of August, and the hours in "Est. Hours" would reflect the total hours forecasted to each of them for the month. Contrarily, Brendan, Miina and Joshua are on a project that invoices semi-monthly. The "Est. Hours" column in this instance would reflect the Forecasted hours for the 1-15th of the month, or the 16-30/31st of the month.
