# Reviewing Overall Team Availability

We currently utilize a board in Monday.com called the "[Team Availability](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/387604870)" board. While Forecast is still our day-to-day source of truth on what project work team members are allocated to, the Team Available board is a tool we use weekly to ensure we have an overarching view of where, and what kind, of capacity our team has. 

The board is updated on Monday mornings, in preparation for a weekly Team Scheduling call. You will find a "Last Updated..." label at the top of the board below the title, which will indicate if the board has been updated yet for the week when you are reviewing.

The board is separated into 5 groups: Immediate, Next Fornight, If Needs Arise, Potential and Done. Below you will find explanations on what falls into each of these groupings:

### Immediate

Any team member who at the time the board is reviewed has existing capacity will be moved into, or added to, the "Immediate" group. As a project manager, if you have a quick and immediate need \(e.g. code review, or someone to take a QA look at something\) you can utilize the "Immediate" group to get an understanding of team members who may be able to assist on a quick-turnaround task.

### Next Fortnight

This grouping consists of any team members we expect to have avaialbility _within_ the next fortnight. This helps us to focus our attention on placement \(internal work or project work\) for team members falling in this group, or the immediate group, first.

### If Needs Arise

This group consists of team members who are allocated to projects, but either the team member has some flexibility, or the project does. Therefore, if something comes up that requires a skillset that they have, we can potentially shift their allocation for a certain duration once confirming with any existing PMs.

### Potential

Any team members who are on projects that either are carrying on indefinitely, but _could_ stop...or ones where we havent received confirmation on continuation fall into the potential category...essentially, we are monitoring. 

### Done

This is where line items go when they are no longer active \(meaning...a team member is allocated at their desired capacity again\)
