# Change Orders

Whenever a change occurs in a contract, fixed or T&M, there is possibility a Change Order is needed to align both parties \(XWP and Client\) on the change.

## T & M

A [Change Order](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqTnlVspeEzSP_bbMFn1PtKqpgtys57ploC4qKXwouM/edit#) \(CO\) is needed whenever something in the contract, that is not written flexibly changes. This could be a change in rate to help the client relationship, a change in deliverables, etc. Communicate to the client that a CO is likely needed, and that you will be discussing it with their Account Manager. Let the Account Manager know a CO is needed.

## Fixed

A [Change Order](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dqTnlVspeEzSP_bbMFn1PtKqpgtys57ploC4qKXwouM/edit#) \(CO\) is needed whenever something deviates from the fixed portion of what is defined in the contract: scope, price or both. If the team is made aware of revised, added/removed/changed, scope from what was defined in the contract a CO needs to be created to define the deviation. If there is a budget extension needed on a fixed price project, a CO is needed. Communicate to the client that a CO is likely needed, and that you will be discussing it with their Account Manager. Let the Account Manager know a CO is needed.
