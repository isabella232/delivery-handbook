# Reporting Tasks - Internal

## Monthly Updates/Tasks

* Send out monthly client reports, if applicable
* Validate/update Monday.com's Project Budget board and estimates in the Project Revenue board \(under the Estimated Hours column\)..._note: the Est. Hours will be on par with the numbers depicted in Forecast._
* Review the project's SOW often, but at least monthly, to ensure we are always meeting the deliverables and milestones
* At the end of the month, for the upcoming month, please update Forecast
  * Use your MSA/SOW to determine your baseline for the fixed or estimated T & M for the month coming up
    * You can typically set your Forecast for the duration of the SOW timeline, using your estimate
    * However, Forecasts will change and evolve to be sure to update accordingly
  * If you don't yet know the upcoming Forecast for the month ahead, please provide a conservative number, but don't leave this blank, unless the SOW is not yet defined
    * Add a comment in the Forecast cell, for that particular Project, if something requires more explanation
  * Throughout the month, your Forecast should be updated weekly as needed \(as in the case when you revise budgeted hours in your budget tracker, if you have one, and Forecast\) &gt; see the Weekly Forecast section below
  * If you have a Fixed-Price Engagement
    * Fixed-price engagements fall into two categories: fixed price for a period of time, and fixed price for scope
    * When the price is fixed for a period of time, regardless of what we deliver, then divide the revenue by the number of months
    * When the price is fixed for a described scope, predetermine what portion of scope will be completed each month of the expected length of the project. At the end of the month, determine what portion of that month's scope was completed. For example: If the team completed 80% of the scope included in month 1 by the end of the month, even if all the hours expected to be used by the time that benchmark was reached have been logged, we should only accrue 80% of the revenue originally intended to be accrued in that month. In contrast, if we complete far more scope than expected, we should accrue additional scope.

## Bi-weekly Updates/Tasks \(ahead of the PM sync\)

## Weekly Updates/Tasks

* Validate/Update Forecast
  * The amount of hours you believe we'll generate for the week based on the data you have \(if you have incomplete information, make your best guess\) - enter this weekly and adjust each week as needed
  * Update any time if there is a change in the amount of hours you believe we'll generate
  * This needs to updated in real-time, as this provides the Ops Team with capacity and supports making decisions around team scheduling
* Validate/update Monday.com's Project Budget board and estimates in the Project Revenue board \(under the Estimated Hours column\) 
* Review, then approve Timesheets in Harvest on Monday - be sure to ask your team members to submit at the end of their work week for the prior week, or Sunday at the latest
