# Project Retro Action Items

Whenever a Retrospective is completed, and has actions that are pertinent to more than just the project team, we should log those actions on the [Retro Action Items](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/1151871354) board in Monday.

This board has three sections:

1. **In Progress Retro Action Items** - where action items currently being worked on should be moved to/represented
2. **New Retro Action Items** - where newly logged retro action items should be added
3. **Completed Retro Action Items** - where the action items that have been fulfilled are moved to

When adding an action item to the Retro Action Items board please either work with the team to begin actioning on the item, or flag Mackenzie to gather assistance from other team members to help move the action item forward.

The goal of this board is to create cross-team and cross-project transparency on action items that result from our project retrospectives.
