# Setup Harvest and Forecast

## Harvest

In Harvest, go to [Projects > New Project](https://xwp.harvestapp.com/projects/new)  to get started. Use the guidelines below to set up the new project. If you also need a Client added, ask in the #projectmanagement channel for a Harvest administrator to add it (e.g. Arlen or Mackenzie)

**NOTE: DUE TO AN UPDATE IN THE TEAM SCHEDULING PROCESS IT IS LIKELY THE PROJECT YOU ARE SETTING UP ALREADY EXISTS IN HARVEST AND FORECAST AND JUST NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED. PLEASE SEARCH FOR THE PROJECT BEFORE STARTING NEW.**

1. **Client**: Select the Client the project is associated with. If the client does not exist in the dropdown ask a Harvest administrator to add it (e.g. People Services or Technology)
2. **Project Name**: Use a short, simple working title for the project that the team and client understand (enter any explanation for abbreviations, etc, in the notes), this is likely already defined in the SOW
3. **Project Code**: Start this with the client abbreviation (keep the same as on other projects for this client, e.g. GGL for Google). Then add a very short (1-3 letter) abbreviation for the project itself. The end result would be something like GGL-AMP for the Google AMP project.
4. **Dates**: Optional, to be included if definite start and/or end dates have been set for the entirety of the scope.
5. **Notes**: Populate with anything unique about the project that is helpful to accompany its existence in Harvest
6. **Forecast**: Check the option to create a project in Forecast so team members can be scheduled there.
7. **Project Type**: Select Time & Materials or Fixed Fee depending on the type of project.
   * **Time & Materials** (standard)
     * **Hourly Rates**
       * If the project has a blended hourly rate, select “Project Hourly Rate” from the dropdown
       * If the project has individual rates per team member, select “Person Hourly Rate” from the dropdown
     * **Budget**
       * If there is a specified budget, select “Total Project Fees’ from the dropdown and enter in the amount
       * If the project is ongoing, and there is no total budget, select “No Budget”
       * Check the box for "Send email alerts if project exceeds 80% of budget"
   * **Fixed Fee** (rarely)
     * **Project Fees**: Enter in the total amount for the project
     * **Budget**: Select “Total Project Hours”, enter in the amount of hours the fixed price was based off of
     * Check the box for "Send email alerts if project exceeds 80% of budget"
8. **Permissions**: Leave to default of “Show project report to project managers on this project, and administrators.”
9. **Tasks**:&#x20;
   * Remove all default tasks, except “Meeting”.&#x20;
   * Add in tasks relating to epics/deliverables for the specific project
   * Add a “Project Management”
10. **Team**: Add team members. If hourly rates are needed, enter them based on the individual's role and the rate specified in the SOW.

Once the new project is setup, post a message in the [#finance-services](https://app.slack.com/client/T02UB976M/C4W8CE727) Slack channel flagging Monika Kos:

> @Monika Kos, I just set up a new project in Harvest for the \[Project Name] project for \[Client]. Can you take a quick look to make sure everything seems to be in order?  (link to Harvest Project and SOW).
>
> @arlen We'll need this project added to XHQ as well now please!

Arlen will create a synonymous project in XHQ to account for contractor invoicing.

**Note for XHQ setup:** Harvest ID and Project name must match in Harvest and XHQ for integration to work. Be sure to add a new project in Harvest for each SOW that is signed, and track work accordingly.
