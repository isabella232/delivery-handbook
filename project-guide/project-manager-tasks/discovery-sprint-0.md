# Discovery / Sprint 0

## **What is this?**

Almost all clients will have a period of Discovery to research and formulate solutions and recommendations, otherwise referred to as Sprint 0. This may be as short as one week, or as long as several months, depending on what was agreed to in the SOW and/or with the client.

## **What are the Deliverables, once this phase is complete?**

### Discovery Documentation 

All projects should create a report for the client called Discovery Documentation, delivered prior to the implementation phase, or Sprint 1 starts. Please use the [\[TEMPLATE Client Name\] Discovery Documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QXJY7gvp0Jf4RJTg1jHkZRlTOoghFgRs4Jz0PiUReuk) to collaborate with your assigned team internally. Once this has all sections complete, mostly contributed by the Architect/Lead Engineer, with the PM and PO's support, the PM will deliver to the client POC. PMs, please be sure you allow time for the PM to review along with the CTO/Head of Partnerships, prior to delivering to the client.

### Product Backlog

As a result of your Discovery efforts, an initial product backlog should be created ahead of the implementation, or Sprint 1 start and before you deliver the documentation outlined above. See the Setup Jira section in the Project Manager Tasks of this documentation to set this up.

### Estimate

As a result of your newly generated Product Backlog and Discovery efforts, an Agile Estimate should be created by the PM. PMs, please work with the PO and Architect/Lead Engineer to flesh out a final estimate, using the [Estimation Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KE_EXXlL_LVyyy36aVydDrt7GR_yYV1OVKyhfE9E5js), created ahead of the implementation, or Sprint 1 start, but before you deliver the documentation outlined above, as the final estimated number needs to be added to the Discovery Documentation under the Budget section. Be sure to make a new copy of the template, specific to your project. Please see the Estimating section under the the Project Guidelines section in this documentation, on how to estimate.

### Project Documentation

All projects should create Project Documentation for each client, delivered prior to the implementation phase, or Sprint 1 starts. Please use the [\[TEMPLATE Client Name\] Project Documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wo7JvwIDEHEh4pSaBgj_naXAq3wqPi1DV7cte2GImW4) to collaborate with your assigned team internally. Once this has all sections complete, mostly contributed by the Architect/Lead Engineer, with the PM and PO's support, the PM will deliver to the client POC, along with the Discovery. PMs, please be sure you allow time for you to review this, prior to delivering to the client.

### Client Project Brief

Each project should have a Client Project Brief, delivered during this phase, once a client has decided to work with XWP, in any sort of capacity. The Head of Partnerships or Sales, is responsible for delivering this to the PM and the selected team and capturing the details in the brief through their conversations, meetings, email and Slack conversations. They are also required to go over the Brief in the Internal Kick-off call, along with the MSA/SOW and any other documentation deemed important for sales to go over with the implementation team. Sales will use this template: [\[TEMPLATE Client Name\] Client Project Brief](https://drive.google.com/open?id=148bjn-9sRihk3MFERyrjFmmEVIzSRmC217G5xBMb81c), to create one for each prospective client.
