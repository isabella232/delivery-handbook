# Lean Agile at XWP

_Note: if you are using our normal Scrum process, please refer to the_ [_Setup Scrum_](setup-scrum/) _page._ 

XWP's prefered methodology when working with Client's is Scrum, and includes all of the normal Rhythms and Ceremones, however, there are times when a leaner approach is needed. This page is intended to help create a basis for how XWP should engage with clients in this leaner format. 

**There are two approaches we recommend: Lean Scrum and Lean Kanban** _\(note: currently, XWP does not run projects utilizing robust Kanban practices. If you have a project that you feel this is required for please reach out to Head of Delivery\)_

## Goals of Lean Agile

1. Support the Team, ensuring they have the information to carry out the necessary work
2. Client satisfaction and alignment
3. Leaner meeting cadence, and attendees in meetings, to help keep budget focused on the output and less on the meeting time

## Lean Scrum

### Recommended Rhythms and Ceremonies

#### The Sprint

Even in our lean approach, we work in 2 week sprints. This is a consistent at XWP, and keeps our projects aligned and easy to manage. _If there is a warranted reason to deviate from 2 week sprints, please bring it up with the Head of Delivery or during a Project Manager Internal Sync._

#### Ceremonies

* **Stand up** - this should be business as usual, and utilize our Workflow \(see the table within [Setup Scrum](setup-scrum/#meetings) regarding setup in a specific Slack channel\)
* **Backlog Grooming/Sprint Planning** - while these meetings are normally preferred to be separated, to condense time, we can combine them utilizing the following approach
  * Cadence - every two weeks
  * Approach - time box the agenda of these meetings, and constantly be grooming for 2+ sprints ahead, while you plan for the upcoming sprint 
    * First 40 minutes - grooming the backlog for future sprints
    * Last 20 minutes - planning, and pointing, the upcoming sprint
* **Sync/Demo** - in weeks between Backlog Grooming/Sprint Planning an external sync with the Client is a healthy place to ensure we are all aligned, and allow any questions about the work being completed. If there are items to Demo, that can be done here as well. _\(An even leaner approach is to have the Team record quick screencasts of completed work, and upload into a shared folder...allowing the Client time to review ahead of the sync, so the sync is focused on question and updates, and can be limited to 30 minutes\)_
* **Retros** - similar to Stand up...these can be taken async. We can utilize a poll, or an open ended Slack thread to help improve on our processes.

### Communication to Client

While we are working leaner than our normal Scrum process, it is imperative we are communicating with the Client on the progress we are making. Ceremonies listed above help to maintain alignment, but a **regular report** is critical to ensure we are demonstrating our work, and the client is aware of the work being done. Please find a reporting/communication style and rythm that works best for you and the Client. We have templates that exist as best practice starting points, but they are intended to be modified to work best for each project. Keep in mind - if we are using Lean Scrum its likely because the Client \(or budget\) warrants a lean approach...the brevity, yet comprehensiveness, of the reporting should be taken into consideration here. 

Additionally, it is important that our Clients engage with us in our tooling, and therefore recommended that all Clients be added to, and prompted to use, Jira and/or GitHub with our Teams. 

## Lean Kanban 

### Rhythms and Ceremonies

#### Rhythm

One of the biggest drivers to Kanban is its lack of a true rhythm. This does not mean it is a free for all, however. Instead of being boxed into sprints, like Scrum, in Kanban we are prioritizing and working through a queue of groomed, ordered items. These items are all driving towards certain milestones/goals. It is extremely important as we work in this process we check in with our Clients to ensure we are still focusing on the big picture, and do not get caught in the weeds of having many individual tickets that do not produce a large outcome. 

#### Ceremonies

* **Stand up** - this should be business as usual in regards to utilizing our Workflow \(see the table within [Setup Scrum](setup-scrum/#meetings) regarding setup in a specific Slack channel\). However, we should be adjusting our questions slightly for projects working in our Lean Kanban approach to the following:
  * What did I work on yesterday?
  * What am I working on today?
  * What issues are blocking me?
  * What goal\(s\) is my work contributing to?
* **Strategy Review** - the cadence of this can vary depending on the size of the project, but the goal is simple - having a set touchpoint throughout the work to ensure we are aligning with the Client regarding the strategic direction we set out on, where we are now, and what has changed/needs to change.
* **Prioritization, Board Review, Ticket Definition** - even without sprints it is important to be defining issues as a group and validating/prioritizing them with Client. This meeting should occur weekly, or every other week, and can last anywhere from 30-60 minutes, but serves as a place where the Client and the Team align on the prioritization of the board, and ensure all items are fully defined and accurate.

### Communication to Client

While we are not working in sprints, and instead focusing on priorization and milestones, it is imperative we are communicating with the Client on the progress we are making. Ceremonies listed above help to maintain alignment, but a **regular report** is critical to ensure we are demonstrating our work, and the client is aware of the work being done. Please find a reporting/communication style and rythm that works best for you and the Client. We have templates that exist as best practice starting points, but they are intended to be modified to work best for each project. Keep in mind - if we are using Lean Kanb an its likely because the Client \(or budget\) warrants a lean approach...the brevity, yet comprehensiveness, of the reporting should be taken into consideration here. 

Additionally, it is important that our Clients engage with us in our tooling, and therefore recommended that all Clients be added to, and prompted to use, Jira and/or GitHub with our Teams. 

## Jira Board Setup

Even though we are working in a leaner manor, we still need to ensure that our Jira projects and Boards are setup in a proper way.

For ALL projects please refer to [Setup Jira](setup-jira.md) guide, there are steps in there explicit to setting up both Scrum and Kanban projects.
