# Reporting - External/Client

## Status Reporting

Ideally we offer all clients a status report. Have you asked your client if they require this? Have you checked the SOW to validate what's required? The cadence of the status report can vary depending on project type, as well as client requests, and typically are:

* Weekly 
* Sprint
* Monthly
* Quarterly

**What is in a Client Status Report, and how to use it?**

The Client Status Report contains client-facing data pertaining to a specific time period, or multiple specific time periods. You can adjust the report to be weekly, monthly or by Sprints or whatever fits the needs of the client. 

**Step 1**: Discuss with the Account Manager, and consult the SOW to determine if any status reporting needs were already agreed upon with the client.

**Step 2**: Determine which cadence of reporting makes sense \(note: if the project is Sprint based, recommend Sprint based status reporting to your client\). Make a copy of the report, linked below, for your client. In some instances, your client will not require reporting, so be sure to validate what meets the client's reporting needs.

**Step 3**: Setup the status report by using the [Status Report Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yiIqmnGRZB42M_Xvlo6bZgZeezPtF4zQOnyXuYuK_aY/edit#gid=576735664). Review the [video here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vYvOfKhZrozNvxk1JA09Ndjl-2Gbic0X), and the [instructions here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l_Y2WejM5mbplKOL69P_1VltPEWKcqFWhBVTCFr7lfc/edit#gid=2017061291), on how to setup and use the status report. If you have any questions please reach out to the the Delivery Lead. Note: this template is intended to be modifiable, remove any sections or tabs that are not relevant \(e.g. you may not need to report on hours, but rather Sprint\). The Status Reports Instructions, Template, and Video can all be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vYvOfKhZrozNvxk1JA09Ndjl-2Gbic0X?usp=sharing) on the XWP Google Drive.
