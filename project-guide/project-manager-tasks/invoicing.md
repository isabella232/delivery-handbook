# Invoicing

Project Managers, or Account Managers if there is no Project Manager, are responsible for sending Finance invoicing data when invoices are needing to be sent. Each of our projects may have a different invoicing schedule \(monthly, weekly, sprint based, fortnightly, etc.\). It is up to the Project Manager, or Account Manager, to know when an invoice needs to be sent. That information should be available in the SOW.

Prior to putting together the details of the invoice, ensure that all contributors time is entered in Harvest \(it does not need to be submitted\), and reviewed.

All invoicing is handled via the [Current Fiscal Year Revenue board](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/1082445381) in Monday.com

## Setup for a new Project

When a new project signs, and you are serving as the Project Manager, you will want to look at Monday.com at the [Current Fiscal Year Revenue board](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/1082445381). Start by searching for the project \(top right\) to ensure no one has created an invoicing section yet. If none exists follow the below steps:

1. Client the "v" next to "New Item" \(the big blue button\)
2. Select "New group of Items"
3. Rename the title of the group to the Client/Project name \(e.g. Google AMP Plugin\)
4. Setup the first invoicing line \(possibly a deposit\), by naming the first column accordingly \(e.g. Initial Deposit, or if the first invoice is based on work, enter a line item the way you would enter it on the invoice, e.g. "Project Management", "Team Member Name", etc.\)
5. Follow the columns left to right, and input information into the following
   1. **Link to Clients** - Search for the Client, if one does not exist and you need assistance reach out to Mackenzie, Tanya or Arlen
   2. **Project Code** - Should match Harvest
   3. **NET** - from the SOW
   4. **Client** \(last column\) - Find the Client code, if one does not exist and you need assistance reach out to Mackenzie, Tanya or Arlen
6. All other columns are variable, and will either be filled out by Finance or should be filled out specifically based on the invoicing needs \(see below\)

## How to input Invoicing Data

Each time invoicing occurs please follow the requirements in the SOW to properly itemize entries into [Monday.com](https://xwpco.monday.com/boards/375085277). Some invoices require items broken down by role, others by team member, others by task, etc. 

At the time of invoicing create line items for any entry that needs to appear on the invoice. Ensure that they are in a "backlog" status until they are ready to go. Below are columns that you will be filling out, based on the type of contract we have _\(note: the columns you filled out during setup, above, will need to be on each invoicing line. The easiest way to do this is the duplicate the previous entry\)_

* **First column \(summary\)** - every entry should have a specific summary \(e.g. Initial Deposit, Project Management, Team Member Name, etc.\)
* **Description** - additional identifier of what the invoicing item is
* **Role** - if the project has team member itemized invoicing, enter the role the team member is serving in this column
* **Team Member** - if the project has team member itemized invoicing, enter the name of the team member in this column \(it will search the database\)
* **Billable** - this is where you enter the hourly rate for the invoicing item 
* **Deposit** - this column is used if the line item is specificly a deposit
* **Fixed** - if the line item is a fixed fee \(e.g. we are charging four $10,000 installments\) that will be represented in this column
* **Hours** - if we are charge T&M, or if we need this information added, please enter the number of hours attributed with the line item here

Revenue and Unpaid Rev. will update automatically based on the provided info above. Once you have completed and reviewed your invoice, change the status to "Ready" and flag Monika in the \#finance-services channel.
