_Please note: the details below outline the expected setup and ongoing tasks for PMs. If you are looking for a way to track these tasks_ [_please reference this spreadsheet_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BXK1ElosJaYMytCFRSzyATPBQ\_FSNUZEyEiolPUIdns/edit#gid=254042165) _that accounts for the below tasks in a spreadsheet format._

## Setup Tasks

1. Create a Google Drive folder - within “Delivery > Projects > Client Projects > [Active](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/107B9EaPa\_Xk6nTttPahVuscKB97f-tiE)" if not already created, this should be the Client Name and a Project Name sub folder inside.&#x20;
   1. Please save the pre-created set of sub-folders in the [Project Folder Structure](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n8jo4gv1KyW6xlFwsU2ku7XymKoptYxf) folder, to your computer. Then, highlight all of those folders and drag them back into the newly set up Project folder for your client, under [Active Projects](https://drive.google.com/open?id=107B9EaPa\_Xk6nTttPahVuscKB97f-tiE), in the Delivery > Client Projects sub-folder. Note: if you experience issues with moving these folders onto your computer and back into the gDrive, please let Mackenzie or Derek know and we will assist in moving them (as how you move them is dependent on your computer/device type).
2. Add a row for the client in the current Fiscal Year's Project Revenue board (within the Finance section) of Monday.com ([see details in Invoicing](invoicing.md#setup-for-a-new-project) for setup of Monday.com if you need help) to prep and house invoicing, usually on the 1st and 16th, but can vary based on the terms of the SOW
3. Add a row for the client in the Project Budget & Health board of Monday.com to reflect the budget for this project, based on the terms of the SOW and should be updated at the minimum alongside the project's invoicing cadence (e.g. every time you invoice, the line in the Project Budget & Health board should be updated)
4. Ensure Account Management has informed Finance, within the [#finance-services](https://app.slack.com/client/T02UB976M/C4W8CE727) channel, about the SOW signing (should include link to Monday.com boards in #3, the contract in Google Drive and payment details etc.)

     * _No action needed from PM > once client accepts invite, XWP slack admin will need to approve_
   * Welcome the client to the channel once they have accepted the invite
   * _Note: whenever possible we look to create shared channels with Client organizations, and avoid having single or multi-channel guests._&#x20;
